<hr> 1. Start number n=1 is odd, so its successor is (3n+1)/2 = 4/2 = 2.

<hr> 2. A number n has two predecessors if n divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2.

<hr> 9. Odd start numbers for the 4n+1 problem remain odd and diverge to infinity.

<hr> 17. Better check that again.

<hr> 18. All are true.

<hr> 22. (143,77) (66,77) (66,11) (11,11)

<hr> 30. 2

<hr> 31. [14 0]

<hr> 35. Any number of the form 2^b 5^b c will have b trailing zeroes. 

<hr> 38. If m = 4n + 2 (see errata), then m is of the form 2^1 c, where "2^1" indicates "a" is the first letter.
